To avoid having to reproduce or copy the code from Assignment 7, you can load the class directly.  First, from the Terminal command line, run the following command to convert the Jupyter notebook into a regular Python file\n",

    " * The $\\LaTeX$ source for the $x$-axis label is `\\frac{\\phi^3}{(1-\\phi)^2}`.  It shouldn't be too difficult for you to figure out the $y$-axis label."
