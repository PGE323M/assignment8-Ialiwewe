    "Since you've already developed fitting routines in [Assignment 7](https://github.com/PGE323M-Students/assignment7/) you should use them to perform the analysis on the data.  To avoid having to reproduce or copy the code from Assignment 7, you can load the class directly.  First, from the Terminal command line, run the following command to convert the Jupyter notebook into a regular Python file\n",

    "Please note that the plot must be **exactly the same** in order for the tests to pass, so take care to note the small details.  Here are a couple of tips:\n",

    " * For plotting the fit lines, use a Numpy `linspace` that goes from 0 to 0.012 with 50 points.\n",
    " \n",
    " * The $\\LaTeX$ source for the $x$-axis label is `\\frac{\\phi^3}{(1-\\phi)^2}`.  It shouldn't be too difficult for you to figure out the $y$-axis label."
